## Documentation Checklist for Functional RTL Freeze
An item is "signed off" once the `Owner` and `Completed` cells are filled in.  `Owner` should be an email address and `Completed` is the date the work was done. If there is an Exception or Waiver, it should be captured as a GitHub issue in core-v-docs and the issue number recorded in the `Exceptions/Waiver/Comment` cell.

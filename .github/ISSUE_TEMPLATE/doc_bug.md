# Template for Documentation Issues
At the OpenHW Group, we know that documentation can have just as many bugs (issues) as code.  So we treat documentation issues
in the same way we treat bugs in code and track them both with GitHub issues.

Please use this file as a template for filing issues against any of the documentation in this repository.
**Hint**: click on the edit symbol (looks like a pencil) and then copy-and-paste the markdown source into your issue.

## Bug Title
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

### Type
Indicate whether the type of problem you found:
* Factually incorrect information.
* Confusing or poorly worded information.
* Inconsistent with either a third-party standard (e.g. RISC-V Foundation ISA) or another OpenHW Group document.
* Spelling mistake or typo.
* Other.

### Location of Issue
Please provide:
1. URL to the document.
2. Git Hash.
3. Sub-section and page number.
4. A snip-it of the text in question.

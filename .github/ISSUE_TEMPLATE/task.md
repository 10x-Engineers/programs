# Template for Task Issues
Tasks are defined, assigned and tracked as GitHub Issues.  For obvious reasons,
the template for a task is very different from the template for a bug.

Please use this file as a template for creating Tasks to create or update any of
the documentation in this repository.
<br>**Hint**: click on the edit symbol (looks like a pencil) and then
copy-and-paste the markdown source into your issue.

## Task Title
A clear and concise description of the Task.  This can do in the titlebar.

### Background information
For Verification Plan related tasks, reference the [VPLAN HOWTO](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/tree/master/verif#how-to-write-a-verification-plan-testplan) document prior to starting this task.

### Document Template
Choose one of the following as appropriate:
* [Verficiation Plan template](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/CV32E40P/VerificationPlan/CORE-V_VerifPlan_Template.xlsx)

### Document Location
Specify the directory of the document.  For example:
<br> A Vplan spreadsheet shall be committed to the [Base Instruction Set](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/tree/master/verif/CV32E40P/VerificationPlan/base_instruction_set) directory.

### Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.

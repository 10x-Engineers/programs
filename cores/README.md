# Documentation for CORE-V cores.

The current view of the CV32E40P and CV32E40 features list can be found in [CV32E40P_and_CV32E40_Features_Parameters.pdf](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/cores/cv32e40p/CV32E40P_and%20CV32E40_Features_Parameters.pdf).  The micro-architecture of the CV32E40P (under construction) is in sub-directory of the same name.   Feature defintions and micro-architectures for other CORE-V cores will be placed in this directory as they come available.

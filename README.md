# core-v-doc
The documentation for the OpenHW Group's set of CORE-V RISC-V cores.  Much, but not all, of the documentation
here is captured in reStructuredText and is rendered to html using
[Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html).
These documents are viewable using readthedocs, see below.

rendering of the CV32E40P user Manual can be viewed [here]().

## VERIF
Verification Strategy, Verification Plans, Workflow plus meeting slides and minutes.  The

## Platform
Information about the hardware and software of the physical platforms built to demonstrate

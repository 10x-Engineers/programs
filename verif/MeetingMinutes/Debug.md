1. Quick Introductions

2. Goals:
- The goal is top-to-bottom and front-to-back (i.e. "complete") verification of the Debug feature in CV32E40P.  This is expected to be achieved via a combination
of random test-programs (generated by [riscv-dv](https://github.com/google/riscv-dv)), manually written test-programs and functional coverage.
- The `debug_req_i` input to the core will be driven either by a yet-to-be-developed UVM Debug Agent or test-programs via a memory-mapped
[virtual peripheral](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sim_tests.html#virtual-peripherals).
- Paul has developed the memory mapped test-program, which is integrated into the UVM environment.   Paul's testcases have yet to be integrated.  How this is
handled with be up to Oystein.
- Proper operation of the core will be determined by checking core results against the OVPsim reference model.

3. Process:
Mike walked the team through the top-down process we will following:
- Oystein & Wajid to capture a debug verificaiton plan.  This is on-going and a [draft](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/CV32E40P/VerificationPlan/debug-trace/CV32E40P_debug.xlsx) is already available.
- Vplan will be reviewed when Oystein and Wajid are ready.  At a minimum Paul must be on the review team.
- Oystein will develop required environment infrastructure and testcases with support from Paul and Imperas (for RM).
- An initial set of directed testcases to prove 'success-case' functionality are expected.
- Ideally, most verification of debug will be done with random tests.
- Completness of effort will be measured by functional coverage (developed by Oystein).

4. Simon walked the team through the operation of the Reference Model

5. Walked walked the team throught the testbench work he has done to date.

6. General Discussion:
- **Lee**: a "halt request" input is available on the RM.  This needs to be available to the testbench via API.
